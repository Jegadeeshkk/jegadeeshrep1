It is a machine learning project.
Use pycharm IDE to run this.
Use 'dataset code' file to download dataset using google colab.
In a IDE create a new project,inside that app.py
Create a 'static' folder and put style.css inside that.
Create 'templates' folder and put index.html inside that.
Add a dataset csv file inside project.
At the time of running a project , it may arise errors to import some libraries such as matplotlib,numpy,flask,pandas,sklearn etc. Import it to avoid errors and run successfully. 
All files such as 1. project review -1 , project review - 2, project review - 3, final project report are for your reference,no need to upload anywhere.

            Best wishes
            people with service minded.
